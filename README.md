# ConnorsDailyPlanner
Application that acts like a daily planner or a work day scheduler. It allows the user to enter in events for any given hour of a work day(9-5) and save them so that they can plan out their day. This application uses localStorage to store the events of a day so that they are not lost when the user exits the page.
